## REST
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style which advocates that the web applications should use HTTP.

## WordPress REST API
The WordPress REST API provides API endpoints for WordPress data types that allow developers to interact with sites remotely by sending and receiving JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. JSON is an open standard data format that is lightweight and human-readable, and looks like Objects do in JavaScript.
